write here what you understood from each task, challenges faced if any 

#Task2
- I tried using z scale normalization in my code in logistic regression as suggested but i was getting 37% accuracy but by using standardscaler i was able to increase accuracy to 92% . Have i made a mistake here

#Task1
- I tried reshaping the data into (-1,1) but this resulted in error whats the need of reshaping itself
- Why is it needed to use X transpose didnt fully get this just know it came in chatgpt

#Task3(Question1)
- I was getting a Dataframe of the shape (32,146) something like this for the y_pred so i had to make it (32,) by using y[:,0] but if i used y[:,1] i got the same metrics which should mean they are all duplicates what would be the reason ?
